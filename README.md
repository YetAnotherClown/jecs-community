## Purpose

The Jecs Community Wiki is a set of documentation and resources maintained by the community. The purpose of this project is to provide quality community maintained resources, while lightening the work load of the Jecs authors.

This project does not intend to replace any first-party documentation, but rather to be an extension to it. If you're interested in improving upon the first-party Jecs documentation, you should contribute to the official repository.

## Contributions

Community Documentation is located in two places:
1. Under the `docs` directory. This is where our documentation pages on the site are hosted.
	- You can find a "🖉 Edit this page" button on all Docs Pages to make quick edits!
2. Or, within our [*Moonwave*](https://eryn.io/moonwave/) doc comments in the source code.
	- Look for the `</>` button on the API page to find doc comments!

Friendly reminder that Jecs has an first-party [*How To*](https://github.com/Ukendio/jecs/tree/main/how_to) series which serves as a step-by-step introduction to how Jecs works and the reasons behind it's design. Does the topic you want to write already exist? Do you think it should? Consider contributing to the first-party documentation for Jecs first!

When writing doc comments, avoid modifying any source code (other than comments) and be sure to follow the [*Moonwave syntax*](https://eryn.io/moonwave/docs/TagList)!
